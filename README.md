I keep a track on the things I read.
<br>
It is such a tragic tale, I guess. 
<br>
I made a tower into which I could see further on the horizon.
<br>
I climbed it all the way up, I made each step believing it would be salvation.
<br>
Later on I found myself depressed, and every time I look at this tower I only wish to fall down and start it again.
<br>
But you can't burn the books you've read, only symbolically though.
<br>
They are already on your mind, and the pure fact that you don't remember most of what you've seen hurts more than not doing anything to begin with.
<br>
If only I could turn back. If only I haven't had become such an arrogant being. Maybe today this tower could provide me joy.
<br>
What else there is to be done, if not to climb further and further? There must be light somewhere out there.
<br>
There should be light, someday.
<br>
Everyday I struggle with the feeling that I am not doing it right. Is the light, in the very end, only seen when you fall? 
<br>
I hope one day all this becomes clear.
